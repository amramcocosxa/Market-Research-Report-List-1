<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Automotive Suspension System Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Independent Automotive Suspension System</li><li>Non-independent Automotive Suspension System</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The automotive suspension system market comprises two main types: independent and non-independent systems. Independent automotive suspension allows each wheel to move independently, enhancing ride comfort and handling by reducing body roll and improving traction. This design is commonly found in passenger cars and high-performance vehicles. In contrast, non-independent automotive suspension features interconnected wheels, where movement in one affects the other, often found in trucks and off-road vehicles for improved durability and load-bearing capacity but at the cost of ride comfort.</p></p>
