<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Non-Invasive Ventilation Respiratory System Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li> Fixed Pressure CPAP Device</li><li>Auto Adjusting CPAP Device </li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Non-Invasive Ventilation Respiratory System market primarily includes two types of Continuous Positive Airway Pressure (CPAP) devices: Fixed Pressure CPAP and Auto Adjusting CPAP devices. Fixed Pressure CPAP maintains a constant pressure throughout the night to keep airways open, making it effective for treating obstructive sleep apnea. In contrast, Auto Adjusting CPAP devices dynamically adjust pressure levels based on real-time respiratory needs, enhancing patient comfort and effectiveness by responding to varying airway resistance during sleep.</p></p>
