<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Cancer Drug based on CAR-T Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Allogeneic</li><li>Autologous</li></ul></p>
<p><p>CAR-T therapy is a groundbreaking cancer treatment that leverages genetically modified T cells to target and kill cancer cells. The market is primarily divided into two types: autologous and allogeneic. Autologous CAR-T uses a patientâ€™s own T cells, enhancing compatibility and reducing rejection risks, but requires individualized processing. In contrast, allogeneic CAR-T involves using T cells from a donor source, allowing for off-the-shelf applications and broader accessibility, though it poses challenges like potential immune rejection.</p></p>
