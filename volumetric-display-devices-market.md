<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Volumetric Display Devices Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Static-volume Display</li><li>Swept-volume Display</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Volumetric display devices are categorized into two main types: static-volume displays and swept-volume displays. Static-volume displays present 3D images that are fixed in a specific volume, allowing viewers to observe them from various angles without motion. In contrast, swept-volume displays create dynamic 3D visuals by projecting images into a rotating or moving volume, providing a more interactive experience. Both types enhance visualization in fields like medicine, design, and entertainment by rendering complex spatial data effectively.</p></p>
