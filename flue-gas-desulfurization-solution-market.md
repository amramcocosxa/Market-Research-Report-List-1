<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Flue Gas Desulfurization Solution Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Wet Desulfurization</li><li>Dry Desulfurization</li><li>Semi-dry Desulfurization</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Flue Gas Desulfurization (FGD) solutions encompass three main types: wet, dry, and semi-dry desulfurization. Wet desulfurization involves scrubbing flue gases with a liquid sorbent, typically limestone slurry, effectively removing sulfur dioxide. Dry desulfurization uses solid sorbents, such as lime or activated carbon, to capture SO2 gases without requiring water. Semi-dry desulfurization combines aspects of both, utilizing a spray-drying process to inject a mixture of sorbents that react with flue gases to reduce emissions and produce a dry byproduct.</p></p>
